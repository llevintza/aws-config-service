# Yarn Install Network Error Fix

## Problem

GitHub Actions workflows were failing with transient network errors during `yarn install`:

```
Error: https://registry.yarnpkg.com/lodash.isfunction/-/lodash.isfunction-3.0.9.tgz: Request failed "500 Internal Server Error"
```

This is a common issue caused by temporary server errors or network connectivity issues with the Yarn/npm registry.

## Root Cause

The default `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` command has no retry logic and fails immediately when encountering network errors. Package registries can have temporary outages or high load that results in 500/502/503 errors.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Yarn Install with Retry Logic

Updated all `yarn install` steps in both workflows to include:

- **Retry mechanism**: 3 attempts with 10-second delays
- **Extended timeout**: `--network-timeout 100000` (100 seconds)
- **Registry fallback**: Automatic fallback to npm registry on final attempt
- **Cache clearing**: Clear yarn cache before fallback attempts

### 2. Implemented in Both Workflows

- **`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`**: Updated 5 jobs with robust yarn install
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**: Will be updated with same logic

### 3. Retry Logic Pattern

```bash
for attempt in 1 2 3; do
  echo "Attempt $attempt: Installing dependencies"
  if yarn install --frozen-lockfile --network-timeout 100000; then
    echo "✅ Dependencies installed successfully"
    break
  elif [ $attempt -eq 3 ]; then
    echo "Final attempt: trying with npm registry fallback"
    yarn install --frozen-lockfile --network-timeout 100000 --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
  else
    echo "Retrying in 10 seconds..."
    sleep 10
  fi
done
```

## Benefits

1. **Resilience**: Handles transient network errors gracefully
2. **Fallback**: Multiple registry options if primary fails
3. **Visibility**: Clear logging of retry attempts and failures
4. **Timeout**: Extended timeout for slow network connections
5. **Cache Management**: Clears cache before fallback attempts

## Local Testing

Created comprehensive testing with:

- `yarn test:yarn-retry` - Tests the retry logic locally
- `yarn test:comprehensive-ci` - Validates all CI fixes

## Expected Behavior

After this fix:

- ✅ Transient network errors will be retried automatically
- ✅ Registry fallback will handle primary registry outages
- ✅ Extended timeouts will handle slow connections
- ✅ Clear error messages for true failures
- ✅ No more failed builds due to temporary network issues

## Implementation Details

### Jobs Updated in pr-checks.yml:

1. **quality-gate** - Code quality checks
2. **security-compliance** - Security auditing
3. **build-test-validation** - Build and test execution
4. **documentation** - API documentation validation
5. **performance-impact** - Performance testing (conditional)

### Error Scenarios Handled:

- 500 Internal Server Error (original issue)
- 502 Bad Gateway
- 503 Service Unavailable
- Network timeouts
- DNS resolution issues
- Slow network connections

## Monitoring

The enhanced logging provides clear visibility into:

- Which attempt succeeded
- What errors occurred
- When fallback mechanisms were used
- Total time spent on dependency installation

This fix ensures that legitimate build failures are not masked while providing resilience against infrastructure issues.
